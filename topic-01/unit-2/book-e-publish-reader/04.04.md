# Open a Course

Recall how a course is opened using the default reader:

- <https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course>

We have a new reader deployed now at a url like this (yours will be different):

- <https://tutors-bremen.netlify.app/course/reference-course>

You now have your custom reader deployed.
