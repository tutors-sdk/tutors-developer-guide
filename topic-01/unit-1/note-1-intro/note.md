# Introduction

What is tutors.

Tutors is a collection of open source components and services supporting the creation of transformative learning experiences using open web standards. It consists of two key components:

- *Generator:*  transforms a [folder of learning content](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-reference-course)  into a Tutors course

- *Reader*: presents a Tutors course as an intuitive, discoverable and attractive [Web experience](https://tutors.dev/course/reference-course)

These components are [developed in the open](https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors) by an active and friendly community, based on a clear [set of values](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual#tutors-values).

Please see the [Tutors Reference Manual](https://tutors.dev/course/tutors-reference-manual) for guidance on creating and publishing tutors courses.
