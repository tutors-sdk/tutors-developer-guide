Tutors is implemented using the SvelteKit front end framework. To deploy to the cloud, Netlify provides suitable infrastructure Create an account on the Netlify service:

We have already use this to deploy our Tutors course. We can also use the service for hosting web applications, specialising in hosting apps based on frameworks like SvelteKit.

Netlify will be able to deploy applications from the Tutors monorepo:
